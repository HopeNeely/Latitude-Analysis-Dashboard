# Latitude Analysis Dashboard

This website dashboard displays information on weather in relation to distance from the equator. The landing page includes the project summary with links to individual plot pages, a comparison page, and a data page. The individual plot pages show a larger image of the plot with a summary of its findings. The comparison page shows the plots displayed next to each other with links to each individual page. The data page contains a data table with weather information on cities from around the globe.

# Process

HTML5 and Bootstrap were used to create the website consisting of 7 pages.
* Landing page contains:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.<br>

* 4 visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.<br>

Python and Jupyter Notebook were used to convert csv file into html table data. Then it was simply copied into the data.html file.<br>
